## üòç MNIST numbers recognition, using DecisionTrees and RandomForests

This is my fourth project on Machine Learning. This project is made for educational purpose. This is the task from "–°–∏—Ä–∏—É—Å - –ö—É—Ä—Å—ã –ø–æ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é". Task was to create a Machine-Learning **RandomForest/DecisionTree** model

There is a weird csv file, that contains images as each-pixel info ü§î This info of handwritten numbers is called MNIST. People are competing for best accuracies of models.

Task required me to create a **RandomForest/DecisionTree** model, that will recognize handwritten numbers.

All unecessary columns with not important information were dropped in order to optimize the model.
As I have noticed, Random Forest turned out to be ~10% better, than Decision Tree. 


## üéØ Results

Those are **RESULTS** (accuracy/precision/recall):
